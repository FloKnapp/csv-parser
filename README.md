# CSV Parser for PHP

Parse .csv files into a key associated array.

## Installation

```bash
composer require webasics/csv-parser
```

## Usage

You have two options to provide your data. One is to provide a filepath and the other is to provide the CSV contents directly.

You can pass the CSV file directly via:

```php
$data = CSV::parseFromFile('./your-csv-file.csv');
```

Or you can pass the contents of the file directly via:

```php
$data = CSV::parseFromString('firstname, lastname,birthdate,city,country');
```

You can also determine if a header row is present in your data with the second argument ```$hasHeader``` set to true, which is the default setting.

When you're providing a header, the resulting output would contain the header columns as keys according to the columns.

#### Example

```php
array(5) {
    ["firstname"] => string(4) "John"
    ["lastname"] => string(3) "Doe"
    ["birthdate"] => string(10) "01.01.1970"
    ["city"] => string(6) "Munich"
    ["country"] => string(7) "Germany"
}
```

When you're not providing a header row, you'd get the output as an indexed array.

#### Example

```php
array(5) {
    [0] => string(4) "John"
    [1] => string(3) "Doe"
    [2] => string(10) "01.01.1970"
    [3] => string(6) "Munich"
    [4] => string(7) "Germany"
}
```

## Tests

The tests are by far not complete currently.
It's missing expected fails like:
- What if the amount of columns doesn't match the header length
- What if the columns have different separators
- What if the enclosure doesn't match when it got another enclosure char in it

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml
```
