# CSV Parser for PHP

Parse .csv files into a key associated array.

## Installation

```bash
composer require webasics/csv-parser
```

## Usage

You can pass the CSV file directly via:

```php
$data = CSV::parseFromFile('./your-csv-file.csv');
```

Or you can pass the contents of the file directly via:

```php
$data = CSV::parseFromString('lastname,firstname,birthdate,city,zipcode');
```

## Tests

The tests are by far not complete currently.
It's missing expected fails like:
- What if the amount of columns doesn't match the header length
- What if the columns have different separators
- What if the enclosure doesn't match when it got another enclosure char in it

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml
```
